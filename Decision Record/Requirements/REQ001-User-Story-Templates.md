# User Story Templates

## Context and Problem Statement

I need to decide on templates to use for my user stories

## Considered Options

- [Atlassian Agile User Stories](https://www.atlassian.com/agile/project-management/user-stories)
- [SHU Development Process User Stories](https://aserg.codeberg.page/shu-dev-process/en/modelling/analysis/user-stories-and-personas/)
- [Aha Simple user story Word template](https://www.aha.io/roadmapping/guide/requirements-management/what-is-a-good-feature-or-user-story-template)

## Decision Outcome

Choose Option "SHU Development Process User Stories", because:

- SHU development process user stories provide traceability
- SHU development processs is well documented
- SHU development process is an ever-improving process

## Consequences

Positive

- The user stories will adhere to the SMART(T) criteria
- The user stories will be estimated and prioritised

Negative

- The user stories will take longer to write than if the other options where chosen
- The testability section is difficult to adhere to as writing unit tests for all user stories is out of scope
