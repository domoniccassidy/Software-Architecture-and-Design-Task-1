# Design Scope

## Context and Problem Statement

I must decide on how broad my scope should be when creating the design

## Considered Options

- Full Domain Design (All Roles and requirements)
- Partial Domain Design (Some roles and some requirements for those roles)
- Shallow Domain Design (One role and some requirements for that role)

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "Partial Domain Design", because:

- I can showcase the main features of the system with only a few roles
- I don't have the time to create a design with all roles
- Very few functional and non-functional requirements could be demonstrated with only one role

## Consequences

Positive:

- The design will have enough scope to showcase the feasibility of the project
- I will be able to create the design before the deadline
- This design will be of high quality

Negative:

- Some areas of the application which stakeholders may be interested in won't be showcased
