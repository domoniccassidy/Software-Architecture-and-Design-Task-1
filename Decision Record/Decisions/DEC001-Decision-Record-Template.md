# Decision Record Template

## Context and Problem Statement

I need to record the decisions made during the creation of the Advanced Foreign Services Project

## Considered Options

- [MADR](https://adr.github.io/madr/) 3.0.0 â€“ The Markdown Any Decision Records
- ["Lightweight" ADR](https://cognitect.com/blog/2011/11/15/documenting-architecture-decisions) - The first ADR template by Michael Nygard
- ["Decision record template by Jeff Tyree and Art Akerman"](https://github.com/joelparkerhenderson/architecture-decision-record/tree/main/locales/en/templates/decision-record-template-by-jeff-tyree-and-art-akerman) - Published in the book: "Architecture Decisions: Demystifying Architecture"

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "MADR 3.0.0", because

- MADR provides the right amount of detail for my project
- It is very flexible with optional sections providing value in some decisions (Zimmermann, 2022)
- "The MADR project is vivid" (koppor and pixelbrackets, 2022)
- There are lots of example of MADR in use
- "Using Markdown allows for me to focus on my message rather than presentation" (Zimmermann, 2022)

## Consequences

Positive

- I can present the decisions and the options considered
- I can view existing templates to ensure I'm following the notation
- I can have slightly different layouts for more complex decisions

Negative

- Some details will not be present (e.g. assumptions and constraints)
