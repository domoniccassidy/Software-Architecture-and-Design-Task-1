# Decision Record Development

## Context and Problem Statement

I must decide on a technology to use to display my decisions

## Considered Options

- Github Pages
- VitePress
- Word Processor

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "VitePress", because:

- VitePress is easy to work with to generate a static website
- VitePress is well documented
- I have professional experience working with VitePress
- VitePress has an active environment with many helpful plugins
- Uses markdown which is universally accessible

## Consequences

Positive

- Development of the decision document will be quick and enjoyable
- The decions will be displayed in an easy to digest manner
- I will not have to learn how to use another technology

Negative

- I will have to host the vitepress site
