# Wireframe type

## Context and Problem Statement

I need to decide on a type of wireframe to use for the user interaction design

## Considered Options

- Low Fidelity Wireframes
- Medium Fidelity Wireframes
- High Fidelity Wireframes
- Interactive High Fidelity Wireframes- high fidelity wireframes which showcase the application in use

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "High Fidelity Wireframes", because:

- Will allow the designs to showcase usability aspects
- Can be made fairly quickly with Figma
- Provides a strong framework for the design (Eleken, n.d.)
- Interactivity does not need to be displayed here as it will be showcased in the POC

## Consequences

Positive

- Allows for creating a proof of concept based directly on the wireframes
- Wireframes created will clearly demonstrate how requirements are to be implemented
- Supports creation of a consistant style early in the design phase

Negative

- Takes longer to make than wireframes of a lower fidelity
- Design becomes somewhat set in stone and any design changes are harder to implement
