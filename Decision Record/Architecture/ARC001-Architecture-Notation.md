# Architecture Notation

## Context and Problem Statement

I need to decide upon a notation to use for my architecture diagrams

## Considered Options

- [ArchiMate Modeling Language](https://www.archimatetool.com/#:~:text=The%20ArchiMate%C2%AE%20modelling%20language,within%20and%20across%20business%20domains.)
- [Unified Modeling Language](https://developer.ibm.com/articles/an-introduction-to-uml/)
- [C4 Basic Notation - Standard Boxes and Lines](https://c4model.com/#Notation)

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option "C4 Basic Notation" because:

- I do not believe UML contains the necessary items to display different types of user and software systems clearly
- Archimate is fairly complex, with "too many element types and incoherent/fragmented modelling" (R&A IT Strategy & Architecture, 2016)
- A standard box and lines diagram is valid for when no other notation is sufficient (Foucher, 2021)
- The standard box and lines diagram with a legend is very simple to understand

## Consequences

Positive

- I will have the tools to create intuitive architecture diagrams
- Architectural diagrams will be easy to create
- As this isn't really a defined notation, I will be able to add my own elements if required

Negative

- A key will be required to ensure the readers understand the architecture
