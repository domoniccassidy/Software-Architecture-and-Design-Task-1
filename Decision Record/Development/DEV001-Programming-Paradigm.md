# Programming Paradigm

## Context and Problem Statement

I need to decide on a paradigm to use for development of the application and prototype

## Considered Options

- Procedural Programming
- Object-Oriented Programming
- Functional Programming

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "Object-Oriented Programming", because:

- The AFS system is large, complex, and would be actively updated and maintained, which is suitable for OOP (Gillis & Lewis, n.d.)
- I am most familiar with Object-Oriented Programming
- Procedural programming is not suited for larger, complex projects such as this as the code isn't reusable for different projects (Indeed, 2022).
- Functional programming is less suited to applications that may have entities added to it (Dorman, 2022), whereas this applicaiton will have different types of visas added to it.

## Consequences

Positive

- Object-Oriented Programming is great for modularisation and reuse (Singh, n.d.)
- The prototype will be developed in C#, a language I am familiar with
- Encapsulation will improve the readability and security of the code (Singh, n.d.)

Negative

- Object-Oriented Programming can result in larger and more complex code (Singh, n.d.)
- OOP isn't as performant as some other paradigms.
